2 practice model created to get more inference.
In one model I have used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, GBM, and XGBoost to know which are the top performing models.
In one model I have used adusted class weight for imbalance data set (class_weight={0: 0.1, 1: 0.9}) using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN.
